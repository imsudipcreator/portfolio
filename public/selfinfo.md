# About

I’m Sudip Mahata, also known online as @imsudipdev. A self-taught developer, content creator on X (formerly Twitter), and tech enthusiast with a passion for building and sharing.

# Background

I didn’t go through a traditional computer science route. Everything I’ve learned — from HTML to React, from APIs to Web3 — came through curiosity, late-night debugging, and the internet.

Over time, I’ve explored multiple areas:

Frontend Development: Building responsive, accessible, and elegant interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js.
Backend & APIs: Experimenting with Node.js, Express, and Supabase for handling data and authentication.
Web3 & Blockchain: Diving into Solana, Rust, and decentralized app architecture.
Design & Minimalism: I care deeply about UI/UX — every pixel matters. My personal brand and portfolio reflect a minimalist aesthetic that’s simple, fast, and distraction-free.

I believe that learning in public is the fastest way to grow. My X account isn’t just a social profile — it’s a journal of experiments, thoughts, and lessons from building in public.

# Projects

Here are a few things I’ve worked on and continue to build:

🖼️ T3Gallery
A clean, minimal image gallery built using the T3 stack (Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, and tRPC). It’s fast, aesthetic, and fully open source.

🌐 Portfolio — imsudip.is-a.dev
My personal portfolio website, built to be ultra-lightweight, showcasing my projects, learning journey, and thoughts. Built with Next.js and styled with TailwindCSS.

🧩 Imago LLC (Concept)
An initiative exploring decentralized, privacy-friendly apps. I’m experimenting with Web3 tools, blockchain integrations, and minimal user-first designs.

💡 Open-Source & Experiments
From UI snippets to full-stack prototypes, I publish my code openly on GitHub — not just to showcase skills, but to help other developers learn through real examples.
