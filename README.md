# 🚀 imsudipdev — Developer Portfolio (v0.4.0)

A modern, multi-mode developer portfolio that blends **GUI**, **AI**, and **CLI** experiences — all in one interface.  
It’s not just a personal site — it’s an **interactive workspace** that reflects how I think, build, and create.

> 🧠 “Because a developer’s portfolio should feel as dynamic as their code.”

---

## 🧩 Overview

This is my **personal portfolio**, reimagined as a hybrid platform:

- 🖥️ **GUI Mode** — a minimal, fast, and elegant interface showcasing my journey, projects, and work.
- 💬 **AI Mode** — an embedded AI assistant trained on my style and content — ask it anything about me, my projects, or tech.
- 💻 **CLI Mode** — a fully functional web terminal that lets you explore my portfolio using commands like `help`, `projects`, `skills`, etc.

It’s part website, part AI companion, and part developer tool — built from scratch to be as _personal_ as it is _functional_.

## ⚡ Features

- 🧠 **AI Integration** — chat with an AI trained on my developer profile & projects.
- 💻 **Web Terminal (CLI)** — simulate a real shell and explore my portfolio via typed commands.
- 🖥️ **Responsive GUI** — minimal UI for quick visual browsing.
- 🧩 **Command Parser** — custom-built system that handles aliases (`help`, `h`, `?`) and contextual outputs.
- 🌗 **Light/Dark Terminal Theme** toggle.
- 🧠 **Auto Scroll + Session History** like a real terminal.
- 🔗 **Clickable links** inside CLI responses (projects, socials, contact).
- 🪶 **Type-safe & modular architecture** written entirely in **React + TypeScript**.
