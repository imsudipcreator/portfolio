# About

I’m Sudip Mahata, also known online as @imsudipdev. A self-taught developer, content creator on X (formerly Twitter), and tech enthusiast with a passion for building and sharing. Founder of imago llc and Father (creator) of Skibidi Programming Language.

# Background

I didn’t go through a traditional computer science route. Everything I’ve learned — from HTML to React, from APIs to Web3 — came through curiosity, late-night debugging, and the internet.

Over time, I’ve explored multiple areas:

Frontend Development: Building responsive, accessible, and elegant interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js.
Backend & APIs: Experimenting with Node.js, Express, and Supabase for handling data and authentication.
Web3 & Blockchain: Diving into Solana, Rust, and decentralized app architecture.
Design & Minimalism: I care deeply about UI/UX — every pixel matters. My personal brand and portfolio reflect a minimalist aesthetic that’s simple, fast, and distraction-free.

I believe that learning in public is the fastest way to grow. My X account isn’t just a social profile — it’s a journal of experiments, thoughts, and lessons from building in public.

# Projects

Here are a few things I’ve worked on and continue to build:
